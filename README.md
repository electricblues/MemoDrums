# Memo Drums

## Description

I created a small memory game where the player needs to reproduce a pattern of sounds

Written using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;
Also, the sounds are from:[WesBros's 30DayChallenge - JavaScript Drum Kit](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/sounds)

## How to Play

Play back the sounds your hear in the order they're first played to you

## Future Enhancements

Keep track of the max score in local storage
Make it mobile friendly by using touch events instead
